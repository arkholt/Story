## Three

It was dark inside. Dark, cold, and quiet. So much so that Antuvir thought he might have gone blind and deaf. Perhaps that's what happens to unauthorized people when they enter the tower. Had he entered the tower at all? While he could see nothing, he got no feeling of any kind of enclosed space. He felt as if he was in a wide, open field at night. Maybe he'd been transported somewhere instead of entering the tower. Maybe what he'd entered wasn't a door, but a portal of some kind. While he might run into something, he decided to try to find some kind of clue in the dark that would tell him where he was. He cautiously put one foot in front of the other.

That's when things began to get very uncomfortable.

He saw a small point of light in the upper left corner of his vision. It wasn't a light that lit up the room so that he could see anything. It was in his eye, or in his mind, or something. It blinked on and off at regular intervals, sometimes growing larger and sometimes shrinking. As soon as he stopped moving, it disappeared from his view. When he started moving again, it appeared again, as did the large crashing sound that he began hearing in his head. Like the light, it didn't seem to be coming from anywhere, it was just inside him, somehow. Oddly, he wasn't confused by any of this, but simply intrigued. He continued to walk, the light continued to flash, and the sound continued to crash, and a pain began pulsating in his shoulder. It eventually moved all the way down his arm and into his hand. It was right after he began feeling his fingers about to be torn off that he then smelled something awful. He then tasted something awful as well, but he didn't give it much notice because he was having trouble staying awake. He had the unfortunate idea that it might be best to simply lean back, fall on the floor, and go to sleep. The consequence of that unfortunate idea were, however, not very unfortunate. 

As he leaned backward, he fell, but did not seem to hit the floor. He fell through the floor, continued falling in the same arc, and ended up again standing in the same spot he had started from. He tried to fall forward with the same result. He again tried to walk forward and walked on the floor, not falling through it, though this time he was certain he had walked through a wall that he couldn't see. He was also certain that, although he couldn't see anything, he *was* walking through the Fos Brashbif tower. He knew that it was ornately decorated, most of it was a shade of pale blue, and it contained more than its fair share of mirrors. He wasn't sure how he knew this. He wasn't really sure of anything that was going on. He was tired of trying to walk. He decided to run, and that was a bad decision.

It all started falling apart. The tower swirled around him. The swirl surrounded the tower. He surrounded the swirl. He swirled around the tower.

Tower. The tower. Inside the tower. Was he inside the tower? Tower field. A field? A field. An open field. A closed field. An open and closed field inside the tower. Where he thought he was. Was he? Where was he? An open field, an open plain. An open plain inside the tower. Pain! Hot pain, sharp pain. An open pain inside the tower. A closed pain inside his head. Darkness, coldness. A point of light inside the pain inside his head inside the field inside the tower. Light on. Open light. Closed light. Open light.

Still running, but stopped. Slowly running faster than he ever had. Seeing nothing show him everything. Deafening sounds, sounds of deaf, smells of death. It left a bad taste in his mouth. Why was he here? Who was he? Why? Who? How did he get in?

"Who are you? Why are you here? How did you get in?"

It was someone asking him. Amid the confusion, he could... almost... know... someone.

He passed out on whatever it was that caught his fall.

Galtinus was beyond upset. He was angry, which never happened to him, which made him even more angry.
