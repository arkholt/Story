So, what IS the Folne, anyway?

Well, the Folne is nothing. Literally, it's nothing. But in nothing there are infinite possibilities. Anything can be created.

So, everything is pulled from the Folne? As in, summoned?

In a way, perhaps. But in a way, no. Because there's nothing there. But yes, because that's where it all comes from.

Is it possible for something to be *sent* from the Folne? Could infinite possibilities send something to us? Could it send some*one* to us? Could something travel from nothing here? Could something send it*self* to us?

Did you ever think that *you* could be from the Folne?

Do you realize that this whole conflict means absolutely nothing compared to what's out there? Or... what isn't, I guess?

People have actually gone insane trying to figure it out. It's why being a Fos Brashbif takes so many years of training. It's hard to fathom something coming from nothing without losing your mind.
