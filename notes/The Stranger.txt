The Stranger

	Role in Story:  Catalyst
	
	Occupation: Spy for the Co’ak’fol

    

Physical Description:   Fairly tall, for a Co’aktan.  Frail looking hands.  Always dresses in a dark robe, with the hood covering his face to hide his identity.  Therefore, no more physical description can be given.

	Personality:    Quiet.  Reserved.  Rude (though not intentionally, and only in the way of cultural propriety). 
	
	Habits/Mannerisms:  Doesn’t take any care at all to follow the cultural rules of propriety or politeness.  Gets to the point. Never says anything that doesn’t need to be said.

    

	Background: One of the Co’ak’fol, the outcasts.  Snuck back into the city to try to find someone reliable to discuss the outcasts plans, which are dangerous. Doesn’t believe they have the right idea, wants to find a more peaceful solution to the problem.
	
	Internal Conflicts: Wants to help his people, but does not want to betray them.
	
	External Conflicts:  Is being hunted by the Fos Brashbif.  They know about him, but not necessarily who he is.
