"<MASTER, WE HAVE FOUND HIM.>"

"<WHERE?>"

"<AT THE CELER V TRAINING AREA.>"

"<YES.  YES INDEED.  HE WILL DO NICELY.  AS SOON AS HE GETS TO THE PLANET, TAKE HIM AND DESTROY HIS FRIEND, THE GIWEZ.  HE WILL BE OF NO USE TO US.>"

Askratan prepared.  He would find him.  He would please his master.  Tfiwath would assist them.  He would help them destroy the Light ones.  They had disrupted the work of the Ejhklyos for too long.  The purposes of the Ejhklyos would be realized.  His master had led the Ejhklyos from the first days of their conquest.  The Darkness was spreading well, as they had designed it to.  But these Light ones...  Savers.  They and their Planet of Light, the Salvation...  it was all an annoyance.  It would not last long, however.  The Ejhklyos would prevail, and the Tfiwath would help them.  Capturing him was the only hope for the conquest.
