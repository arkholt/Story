Cyame didn't know what he was doing, or where he was going, or what had just happened to him.  He just walked off in the direction that the strange looking guy with a sword had pointed him in.  Calik...  that was his name.  Hm.  Off to the real Krestik then, apparently one of the few large cities left on Celer V.

Cyame wished he had his bike with him.  Sneltrax had wrecked them before he left the fake Krestik, so he had to travel on foot.  Fortunately, Celer V wasn't that big, so it didn't take long.  At least, it usually didn't, if one weren't exhausted and almost brain dead like Cyame was.

He walked, or rather staggered, for a while before seeing anything.  Had he staggered off in the wrong direction?  No, this was...  this was a road.  Not only was it a road, but it led to a city!  Cyame  had found Krestik, finally.  He only wondered what he would do there.

The first thing he did, when he got deeper into town, was fall over.  He needed help, badly.  That Calik was right.  Cyame was too tough, though.  Even though he had lost his partner, and couldn't beat Sneltrax, and had lost...  her...  so many years ago.

But, no.  He wouldn't think about that now.  He'd get help.  If he could stand up.

*  *  *  *  *

Stull saw him fall over.  He was a Saver.  Stull had seen them before.  He didn't like Savers.  This one, however, looked terrible, and helpless.  Stull walked over to him, slowly and carefully.  The Saver started to get up, and Stull darted behind a nearby crate.  He stood up, then looked in Stull's direction.

"Hey, kid," he called, "come out of there.  Maybe you can help me." Stull looked up from behind the crate.  He stood up and walked over.  He knew one could never be too careful around Savers.  They had swords.  This one didn't look like he had one, though...

"What happened to your sword?" Stull asked.  The Saver looked down at his sheath.  It was empty.

"Aww...  I must have left it back at the fake Krestik.  Sneltrax...  why?"  He pounded his fist on his leg.

"Don't worry.  Krestik is nice.  They don't come here...  too often." Stull walked closer to the Saver.

"What's your name, kid?" he asked.

"I'm Stull.  You?"

"Cyame.  I'm a Saver, from the-"

"Salvation.  Yeah, I know.  I've seen your kind before."

"Hmm.  How old are you?  You look so short and scrawny, I wouldn't put you over five." Cyame laughed.

"I'm ten.  You were half right.  And this is Krestik, my home." Cyame took a look around at the scenery: The tall, decrepit buildings, the dark alleys, the junk everywhere, the scent of death creeping over every displaced brick...  He didn't look surprised, though.  Most Savers came here and passed it by, going to Fos or Telmik or Shintramk, or one of the many small, not so terrible looking towns.  This one, however, looked interested.

"Any place I could get some treatment, maybe just a bed to sleep in for a while?" Cyame asked.

"Yeah...  there's old man Galkit's place.  He can probably help you out." Stull smiled.  It was fake, but the Saver smiled back.  His smile was real.

"Thanks, kid." Cyame took a step, then fell over again.  Stull ran over and picked him up.  It didn't look like he'd be getting very far on his own.  Stull carried him over to Galkit's place.  It wasn't far, but for a ten-year-old kid to carry a huge Saver...

*  *  *  *  *

...seemed impossible to Cyame.  The kid did it, though.  Quite a strong little one, this kid.  It was good, because otherwise at this rate Cyame would have been dead in no time.  But the kid...  the kid helped him.

They seemed to make it over to the place the kid had mentioned, Galkit's.  Cyame felt Stull place him on a bed.

"Galkit!  Old man Galkit!" Stull called.  An old man walked out from a back room somewhere.

"What, what?  Stully, you're always bringing strange visitors to me, aren't you?" The old man shuffled over to Cyame.

"Not this time.  This is a Saver from the Salvation.  He needs your help."

"Hmph.  Savers.  Never helped me out any.  Why should I help him? Galkit started to shuffle back to his room.

"Wait...  please." Cyame sat up in the bed.  "I want to help you, but I need your help first."

"Hmph," Galkit said as he walked away. "No Saver's ever helped me.  Don't see why I ought to help one now."

"But...  but Galkit," Stull said, "he can help us.  I know it.  He's different from the others." Galkit stopped.

"What?" Galkit turned and looked at Stull.  "Why do you say that?  He's no different from all the others who passed Krestik right up and marched off to save all the rest of them without giving a thought to the conditions we're in!  Look at this!" Galkit waved his hands around.  "We live in this wretched place, and the only Saver that comes by is one that's looking for a little charity.  Well, I'm not that type." Galkit started to shuffle back to his own room.  Cyame didn't know what to do.  He was completely shut out.  This man's mind and heart were completely closed.  But Cyame couldn't give up.

"I'll save you.  I promise.  I just...  can't...  while I'm..." Cyame started fading out...  what had Sneltrax done to him?  He couldn't think...  and his body wouldn't work...  and then...

*  *  *  *  *

...he fell over onto the bed, limp.  Stull thought he might be dead.  No, he was still breathing, just not very much.  Gah!  Why wouldn't Galkit help him?  He was so selfish.

"Galkit!  Why?  Can't you see?!" Stull yelled.  Galkit turned back and looked at him.

"Quiet boy!  You don't know them.  You don't know what they've done to me!  To...  to...  her..." Stull blinked.  Her?"

"Who?  Who is she?"

Galkit jumped.  "No...  nobody.  Nothing.  I didn't say anything." Galkit looked flustered, and scared, and embarrassed.  Seems it's something important, but what?

*  *  *  *  *

Galkit couldn't believe he'd let that slip.  Silly boy, always prying into his private life.  This Saver, too.  Yeah, looked like one of Them had gotten him good.  He'd probably die if Galkit didn't help him.  Galkit didn't care.  She'd been taken from him so long ago, and the Savers did nothing.  Let him die.  It was only right.

He went back to his study, and locked the door.  That crazy kid might get in and bother him otherwise.  He opened his old book of sketches.  It was worn, and the pages were yellowed with age, but the sketch of her, that he'd done especially for her, was still as beautiful as ever.  He cried every time he looked at it.  Then he got angry.  It didn't have to happen.  He remembered it so vividly.  There she was, standing there, looking up into the sky.  A shuttle came down and landed right next to the building they lived in.  Then the Savers stepped out.  He remembered that the couple next door had just had a baby boy.  There was the other neighbor boy...  Galkit forgot his name...  started with a "Z."  Hm.  Well, he was there.  The Savers stepped out of the shuttle, but that's when They came.  There was nothing to do.  The mom took the baby into the shuttle, and the dad stayed behind.  The little boy tried to get her, Galkit's beloved, into the shuttle, but he couldn't, because the Savers just threw him in.  Then They got her.  They didn't even try to help her.  They didn't.  And then they took off, and Galkit ran away.  He ran away so fast, faster than he'd ever run before.  They didn't get him.  But They got her.

*  *  *  *  *

Stull waited beside Cyame's bedside.  Galkit had gone into his study.  Sounded like he was crying.  Hm.  Stull was extremely confused now.  Galkit had mentioned someone, a woman perhaps.  She had some connection to the Savers somehow, and he was sad about that.  That must be why he wouldn't help Cyame.

Stull knew what was probably wrong.  He had heard that when They fight They're able to make you extremely exhausted, to the point of death if not treated.  This one, Cyame, looked beaten up and exhausted, and almost dead.

But then he awoke.

"Stull..." he said, softly.

"Yeah, what is it?" Stull leaned closer to Cyame.

"I think I remember him.  Galkit." Stull was taken aback.  What?  how could he...

"That's impossible.  He's lived here for..."

"I know.  I used to live here, too.  That's why I came back.  To save...  people..." Cyame coughed.  He looked terrible.  Why wouldn't Galkit help?

"How long ago was that?" Stull asked.

"I was about 5...  so probably 14 years ago...  I lived next to Galkit.  I remember him because he was old then, too...  but the Darkness doesn't allow that." Stull thought for a moment.  Yeah, didn't the Darkness make you die young? "And he'd sketch.  I remember he sketched a picture of a girl I knew.  She was probably 19 or 20.  he loved her like a daughter.  She was like my big sister, and she loved everyone else.  She was perfect.  He sketched her, to try to capture that beauty and love on paper.  He was good, but he still couldn't capture it.  He knew it, too." Galkit must have heard Cyame, even though he was speaking softly, because he cracked open the door of his study.  Cyame didn't notice, however.  He continued.  "Then the Savers came.  We'd been waiting for them.  But They arrived at the same time...  and...  they threw me in.  I tried to take her with me, but they just threw me in the shuttle.  There was a guy who stayed behind to keep Them away.  I hope he lived....  but she didn't.  I know.  She couldn't have.  They got her.  I didn't see it, but they must have.  I never saw her...  again..." Cyame's eyes closed again.  Stull tried to wake him up, but he was getting worse all the time.  Then Galkit came out, sobbing.

*  *  *  *  *

Galkit couldn't believe it.  It was him.  He was the little neighbor boy.  How had he not realized it?  he looked just like he remembered, except older.  He remembered her, too.  He had lost her, also.  Galkit knew then what he had to do.  He had to help this Saver.  Then the Saver could help him.  He wouldn't let Galkit down, because he had experienced the same thing.  Galkit got to work.

He was skilled at healing, and medicines, and such.  He always had been.  He loved to help people, and he'd always wanted to be a famous doctor, but...  well, with Them and the Darkness around, it was difficult.  he had managed to live longer than most people, because of what he knew, and he took care of Stull.  Stull was a very strong boy because of Galkit.  Seems Stull had been able to carry the Saver here.  This one was quite large, too, not including his armor.  Hmph  The Saver armor.  Galkit hadn't needed it, but he wouldn't take it off the Saver.  He didn't want to risk anything.  This one had to live.

He worked away, mixing up the right medicines for the Saver.  Ideally, he'd want to take off the armor, bathe the Saver in nice oils, give him the medicines, and have him rest here for a week or so, but...  well, Galkit was sure if he mixed his chemicals the right way...  Yes.  It would be perfect.

*  *  *  *  *

Cyame awoke.  He sat up in bed.  He saw the kid, Stull, and that old man...  Galkit, standing next to his bed.  They were smiling.  Galkit spoke.

"Feeling better?" he said.  Cyame checked himself for a moment.  Yes, he was feeling better.

"Yeah...  a lot better.  Wow, I feel like I could go conquer all of Them right now." Cyame got out of bed, stood, and stretched.  yeah, he felt awesome.  But...  how?

"It was all Galkit.  He's a master of medicine," Stull said.

"But...  why did you decide to help me?" Cyame asked.

"Because.  I remember you now.  You were the neighbor boy that got thrown into the shuttle that day.  You...  you lost her, too.  I know how you feel.  And you know how I feel, so...  I thought I should help." Galkit looked down at the floor.  Cyame spoke firmly to Galkit.

"I won't be like those other Savers.  I'll save all of you, and I won't leave anyone behind who wants to go." Galkit looked at him.

"You speak the truth.  I know you won't let me down."

Cyame got out his communit.  "I'll call a shuttle right now, and get you and Stull back to the Salvation." Cyame called the Junk Pile, and the shuttle was off automatically.  As soon as it arrived, Galkit stepped in, but Stull didn't move.  Cyame was confused.

"Go on, kid.  Don't you want to go to the Salvation, and leave this junky place?" Stull looked at him.

"No, I...  I want to stay with you," he said.  Cyame laughed.

"Kid, I'm a Saver.  I don't need any help from a little kid." Stull looked angry, and stomped his foot.

"I'm not just a kid, you know.  I'm fast, and strong, too.  Remember, I carried you to Galkit's place." Cyame did remember that...  the kid seemed unusually strong for his size.  But Cyame didn't really...  "See!  Look..." Stull said, and walked over to the shuttle.  "I can pick up the shuttle even."  And Stull proceeded to lift the shuttle up and above his head.  Cyame and Galkit were stunned.  Just a kid, and...  what kind of kid was this?

"Look, kid, I get it now, so please put the shuttle down!" Cyame said.  So Stull did.  Cyame went over to him.  Galkit came out of the shuttle.

"This is no normal boy.  He can help you.  He's strong, because I made him that way," Galkit said.

"What?  How?" Cyame asked.

"You know how I brought you back to your old self?  And how I lived so long out here?  I'm quite knowledgeable about medicines and good health.  I've taught the boy a few things, too.  He'll help you."  Galkit got back into the shuttle, and it took off.  Cyame was left standing there, stunned and stupefied.  What had just happened?
