"So, that's basically what happened," Natobr said.  He had been telling Betronros everything that had happened to them since they split, while they flew the shuttle back to the Salvation.  They had to speak with Captain Sgrith, and Betronros had known why even before he left.  It wasn't right to hold back that kind of information from the thousands of Savers being sent out across the galaxy.

What Calik had told all three of them had helped them realize that.  Now it was time for some answers.
